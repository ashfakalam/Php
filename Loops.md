# THE PHP-LOOPS 
In the following chapters you will learn how to repeat code by using loops in PHP<br>
<hr>

<h1>PHP Loops</h1>
Often when you write code, you want the same block of code to run over and over again a certain number of times. So, instead of adding several almost equal code-lines in a script, we can use loops.
<br>
Loops are used to ececute the same block of code again and again, as long as a certain condition is true.
<br>
In PHP, we have the following loop types:
<ul>
  <li><code>while</code>-loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.</li>
  <li><code>do...while</code>-loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loops as long as the specified condition is true.</li>
  <li><code>for</code>-loops through a block of code a specified number of times.</li>
  <li><code>foreach</code>-loops through a block of code for each element in an array.</li>
</ul>
